# Functional Programming Practical Assignment

## Building the project

To build the project you will need the GHC compiler and all you need to do is run the build script. Once the build is complete the executable can be found in the docs folder.

## Requirements

The output of the project will require you to open bitmap pixel image files. So any software like GIMP that can open this file format will work.
